# Naruto_Characters_Classification

## Please don't shy to suggest edits or ways of improvement. 
## This is a very beginner level project so I know there are a lot of things that need to be worked on. I plan to keep improving the project as I learn more.

The **Naruto_Characters_Classification Project** is a multi class classification project with a final aim of being able to classify among over 50 classes.


Pilot project 1 and Pilot Project 2 are buildups to the main project and have been made as a proof of concept and for learning purposes.

Conclusion from Pilot Project 1 and 2 :   
1.  The project is possible but more data would be better. Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura were the characters for which we had maximum data and still results were not very good.
2.  We will need to go through each image and clean it to remove tags/written material.
3.  Most of the images are in RBGA this leads to problems during visualization.
