# Naruto_Characters_Classification

## Please don't shy to suggest edits or ways of improvement. 
## This is a very beginner level project so I know there are a lot of things that need to be worked on. I plan to keep improving the project as I learn more.

The **Naruto_Characters_Classification Project** is a multi class classification project with a final aim of being able to classify among over 50 classes.


Pilot project 1 and Pilot Project 2 are buildups to the main project and have been made as a proof of concept and for learning purposes.
